# Web-Tech_Mini-Project
This is a shopping website made as a mini project for Web-Tech subject of BCA. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I won't be using any advanced tools as the subject only covers the basics of HTML and CSS.
You can use this repository as you like. I don't mind even if you don't give me credits. Just give a like/star and fork :)
